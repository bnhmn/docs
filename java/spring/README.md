# Spring Boot

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is a framework used to build Java-based enterprise applications.
It simplifies the setup of components needed in typical enterprise applications, providing solutions for web interfaces,
security, validation, data access, batch processing, message-driven communication, documentation, and more. Its aim is
to let developers focus more on application functionality instead of application setup.
