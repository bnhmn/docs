# Kotlin

[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) is a programming language developed by [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/),
designed to improve upon certain limitations of [Java](../java) and to be fully interoperable with it.
It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can be used for a wide range of applications, including Android app
development, server-side applications, and web development. Kotlin is known for its concise syntax, safety features
(like null safety), and modern programming concepts, making it a popular choice among developers.
