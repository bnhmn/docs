# TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a programming language that builds on [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript),
which is widely used for web development and creating interactive user interfaces. By introducing a robust
**type system**, TypeScript helps developers catch errors early, leading to more reliable code. It enhances readability
and understanding, making code easier to maintain, especially in larger projects.

TypeScript can run both client-side in the browser and server-side via [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), making it
versatile for full-stack development.
