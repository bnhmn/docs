# Pre-Commit Hooks

Tools like [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) and [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) allow you
to run certain checks - such as linting and testing - before each Git commit.

Please note: This only works if your npm project is located in the root directory of a Git repository.
