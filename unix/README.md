# Unix

[Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) is a powerful, multiuser, multitasking operating system developed in the
1970s at Bell Labs.
Known for its portability and robustness, it features a command-line interface and a hierarchical file system.
Many modern operating systems, including [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) and [macOS](../macos/), are
derived from or influenced by Unix.

This folder primarily contains information about useful command-line tools that can be used on both Linux and macOS.
